# RDB2RDF
Resource / Reference for JXTreeTable from RDB schema.



This project is now "merged" (in my mind) with 

RDB2XML -> https://github.com/JohnG79/RDB2XML

RDB2XML produces xsd and xml from mysql as of 09/12/2015. 

Next steps for RDB2XML...
- produce rdf and owl. 
- connect to oracle DBs.
- load XML and XSD.
